## Code Refactoring and SEO 

- I was motivated to complete this project so I can add code refactoring as a skill to my resume, and apply my previous SEO knowledge and experience to a website.
- I built it to show how I use problem solving to improve a website's accessibility, with some SEO best practices in mind.
- The problem I solved was updating div elements (non-semantic) with semantic elements such as a good title(50-60 character limit), a header, footer, section, article and aside elements. I also ensure that the heading attributes followed sequential order, and that alt attributes are accessible.
- During this project, I learned how to create a new repo, add it to github (so it is not only stored on my computer), and how to build a strong README.md file!
